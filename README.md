## Review Edition of the Responsive Web Builder v0073
#### Deskspace Systems Limited released the review edition of the new Responsive Web Builder App (rwApp) on Tuesday 18th November 2015.
#### Deskspace's new Responsive Web Builder App (rwApp) enables anyone to create very fast responsive web sites quickly and easily. 
## What is the need for this App?
#### HTML (Hyper text markup language) pages, as originally envisaged and created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, are a wonderfully flexible and efficient means  of communicating with our colleagues and customers.
#### However, the complexities of web site design, creation and deployment often stand between the person wishing to communicate, and what they want to say, and those with whom they wish to say it.
#### The process is often slow, highly concerned about "design" in the visual sense, but unresponsive to the author's need to quickly and easily create and edit content. 
#### There is a growing need for organisations' more formal communications such as policies, procedures and specifications to be easily readable and understandable on any device.
#### HTML pages are the best means of delivering this type of service, provided the process is simple and accessible to anyone and it creates results that meet the needs of mobile users.
#### The Deskspace Responsive Web Builder App offers a method of publishing business, educational, NFP and government documents that is quicker, cheaper and more effective than traditional means.
#### In an every more complex world, where there is a real hunger amongst many people for less complexity, for more simplicity, this App is designed to enable and deliver that simplicity.
